# cv-project
Part of the Odin Project Full-Stack JS course

## Objectives
* Build a CV in HTML using React
* Structure the application into components
* Make each section editable

## Learning Outcomes
* Practice building with React
* Demonstrate OOP by breaking down into components
* GitHub Practice

## Potential Improvements
* Use React-Bootstrap to handle the modal - so we can close on submit rather than separate button. Will require some understanding of React hooks
